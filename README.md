# JetpackComposeWebinar

This repository contains the sample app materials for my Jetpack Compose webinar
for droidcon online on April 23, 2020.

## App Details

The app code is contained in the `ComposeMailPlayground` folder. If you want to
experiment with the app, import the folder using an [Android Studio 4.1 canary
version](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview). This version is
currently required since previous versions do not contain support for Jetpack
Compose.

## Speaker Details

My name is Brian Gardner. I'm a developer and instructor for
[Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com/).

I've been publishing a blog series on Compose on
[my personal website](https://briangardner.tech/) that you can check out for
some more in-depth information.

I also post Compose materials to [my twitter account, @BrianGardnerDev,](https://twitter.com/BrianGardnerDev)
if you're interested in that as well.
